Made By: NYYRIKKI 2008 / KdL 2017-2019 / Cayce 2024

In case someone is interested, there is a bit improved BIOS for One Chip MSX.
You can save RTC settings on SD card by executing 'RTCSAVE.COM'.


Installation:
- Convert an appropriate BIOS from hex-file in binary, OCM-SDBIOS Pack is suggested.
- Format your SD card into FAT16 and copy 'OCM-BIOS.DAT' to the root directory,
  you can also use alternative names like 'OCM-BIOS.DA0' up to 'OCM-BIOS.DA9'.
- Copy 'RTCSAVE.COM' to somewhere and run it to save the RTC settings.


Syntax: rtcsave [{/|-}option]

MAIN-ROM COLOR
--------------
Default settings without no parameter:
 if SCREEN 0  set COLOR foregr,backgr,backgr from RTC
 if SCREEN 1  set COLOR foregr,backgr,border from RTC

Custom settings through options:
 a  COLOR foregr,border,border from RTC
 b  COLOR white,black,black (15,0,0)
 c  COLOR from System Variables in RAM
 x  exclude MAIN-ROM from saving

SUB-ROM RTC CODE
----------------
Perform SET SCREEN from BASIC before saving the RTC code
